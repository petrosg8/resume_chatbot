# Resume Chatbot

A simple AI-like chatbot web application that answers questions about my resume/CV. Users can interact via a chat interface to ask about skills, projects, education. The frontend is built with React + TailwindCSS, and the backend is a Flask API that performs keyword/synonym matching against a predefined set of responses.

## Running the Application

You need to run the backend (Flask) and frontend (Vite) concurrently in separate terminals.

### Start Backend

1. Activate virtual environment (if not already active):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate    # MacOS/Linux
   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Run the Flask app on port 5000:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   * Serving Flask app 'app'
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

### Start Frontend

1. In a separate terminal, navigate to `frontend/`:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   You should see something like:

   ```
   VITE v2.x.x  ready in 200 ms

   ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
   ```

3. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/`.

At this point, you should see the chat interface. Try typing a question like ‚ÄúWhat are your skills?‚Äù and press Enter or click **Send**.
